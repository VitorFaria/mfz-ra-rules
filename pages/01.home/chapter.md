# Mobile Frame Zero : Condensed
## revision 0.96

This document is a faithful reproduction of all the rules of MFZ:Rapid Attack's
Core Rulebook. It has been cleaned, streamlined and simplified were
applicable and is meant to be a resource for quick reference during play
and easy access to the game's ruleset. It does not contain any of MFZ's background.
This version is without any art assets or image other than the dice
icons and meant for mobile use, among other small filesize applications. It
has been created with the efforts of the /tg/mf0/ crowd, the Hangar Crew
and other helpful beings that assisted in cutting the fat.
