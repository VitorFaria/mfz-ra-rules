At the beginning of a game, compare all
present companies against one another.
In general, the player with the smallest,
weakest company gets the points advantage
and starts the battle on the defensive.
The player with the largest, most
powerful company gets a points penalty
and starts the battle on the offensive.

!!! You’ll have to guess your opponents forces while you’re designing your own company to get the position you hope for. The pregame bidding is already part of the tactical calculations!

**The most advantageous companies are:**
* Slightly smaller and weaker, so that you gain the point advantage for little tactical cost.
* Significantly larger and stronger, so that you sacrifice the point advantage for greater force.

## Assets & points per asset

All your frames and stations under your
control are assets. Each asset has a point
value determined by the relative size and
strength of the company you sent into
the field.

### Points per asset & score

Points per asset, ppa, is dependent on
how a company compares to the others.
Every company starts with a ppa of 5.
From here, apply the following modifiers:

| Company has...          | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----                  | :-----
| ...most frames          | -1 ppa
| ...most systems         | -1ppa
| ...least frames         | +1 ppa
| ...least systems        | +1ppa

In case of ties, both players adjust their
scores.

You calculate points per asset once at the
beginning of the game. Your ppa does not
change as the game progresses. Yet, as
you play, you’ll lose mobile frames, and
stations will change hands. This changes
how many assets you hold, not your
points per asset.

!!! Score = Assets × ppa

When the game starts, your score determines
your position in the tactical order,
whether you are the defender, point
attacker or one of the other attackers.

### Ties for defense
When you compare your companies during
setup, you might tie for the highest
score. When this happens, call
odds/evens and roll a die.

** Winner decides: **
* add a frame to their company (if possible).
* remove a mobile frame from their company.
* force the loser to make the same choice.

Compare companies again. That means,
recalculate points per asset, recalculate
starting scores and then proceed.

### Ties for offense
If you tie for the lowest starting score,
call odds-evens and roll a die.

** Loser has to : **
* place the point mobile frame.
* go last in tactical order, until score changes.

!!! If you think you might tie, be sure to bring a spare mobile frame to the game with you.

## Tactical positions

There are three potential tactical positions a
player can have in MFZ. Defender, Point Attacker
and Attacker. The score determines which position
a player holds.

| Player has...          | Tactical Position                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----                 | :-----
| ...highest score       | Defender
| ...lowest score        | Point attacker
| ...neither             | Attacker
