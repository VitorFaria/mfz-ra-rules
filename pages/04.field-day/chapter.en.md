# Field day!
A game of MFZ is separated into three
phases: bidding, deployment and combat.
These phases flow into each other, making
the prior phases influence the following.
A good tactical approach begins before
the first shot is fired. Your score in
the bidding phase gives you a certain tactical
position, which you then apply in
the deployment phase, which in turn affects
your combat phase.
