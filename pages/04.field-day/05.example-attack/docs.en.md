One of Joshua's frames is coming under
attack by ranged fire. It has already been
spotted by one Sebastian's frames and
now one of Vincent's frames is firing.

Luckily, it is in cover.

* Joshua's defense: 5
* Vincent's attack: 3
* Sebastian's spot: 5
* 3 + 5 â€“ 5 = 3 hits.
* Vincent rolls 1, 4, 5 for damage.
* The 1 has no effect, the 4 and 5 deal damage.
* The 4 is resolved first, damaging the cover.
* Vincent removes 6 bricks, removing the cover.
* The 5 damages Joshua's frame.
* Joshua decides to lose 1 defense system.
