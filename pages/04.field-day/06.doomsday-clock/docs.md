At the beginning of a game, put down the
d12 or d20 and set it to 11. This is the
doomsday clock. At the end of every
round, the doomsday clock counts down
by one.

In order from highest current score to
lowest, each player chooses to count
down the DDC by 1 or to pass. When the
DDC reaches 0, the battle ends, and the
player with the highest score wins.

While ties are possible, but unlikely, resolve
them by either going one more turn
or counting who has the most assets left.

!!! Whoever has the highest score will want to advance the DDC, whoever has a lower score will not.
