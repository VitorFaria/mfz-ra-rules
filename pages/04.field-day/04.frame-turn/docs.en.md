title: A Frame's Turn
taxonomy:
    category: docs
---
A frame is either activated by its controlling
player or by coming under attack
from another frame. When activated,
play out the turn in sequence.

**Turn sequence:**
* If you want, declare attack range and target.
* Roll the entire dicepool at once.
* Assign a value to defense.
* Assign the rest of the dicepool accordingly.
* Move, then attack or attack, then move.
* Spot.

## Target Designation
Name a hostile frame as the target of
your attack. You can name no target, if
you prefer not to make an attack. Cover
can also be targeted, instead of a frame.
Stations and your own frames cannot be
targeted.

When you designate a target, you need to
declare which weapon system at what
range is used for the attack. You can declare
a target that is currently out of
range, but you must immediately move
your frame within the declared range or
forgo the attack.

## Roll Dicepool
Pick up the dicepool as per a frame's
loadout and roll them all at once. Assign
dice to defense, movement, attack and
spotting. You can only assign one die per
action. And each die can be assigned only
once.

You can substitute any colored dice for
white dice, as they are wildcards. You
can look at your dicepool results before
you swap white dice in. Swapping is
optional. A frame without a
defense/spot/movement/hand-to-hand
systems must use its white dice for those
functions.

If you do not have enough dice to fulfill
an action, this unassigned action counts
as 0. Once all dice are assigned to
actions, discard any leftover dice.

!!! This includes dice that cannot be assigned, such as a leftover red die, which cannot be assigned to Defense, even if Defense is unassigned.

> **Example :** A frame with WWRdRd rolls:
> * Red 3, 5
> * White 3, 4
> Blue, Green, Yellow have no system left, so Whites need to be assigned. If no white die is assigned to Spot, the Spot is 0. Likewise for movement or defense.

!!! Defense 0 makes for easy pickings!

## Defense
Assign a blue die or a white die to your
defense. If you don't have any defensive
systems, you didn't roll any blue dice, so
choose a white die or forgo your defense,
making it 0 for this round. Place a blue
die on the battlefield next to the frame,
turned to your defense value. This is this
mobile frame's defense for the entire
round, it won't change it until next
round.

If you rolled your frame's dice because
there is attack lined up against your
frame, resolve the attack now. Wait for
your attacker to finish its turn before you
continue yours.

## Move or attack
You may choose whether to attack before
you move or move before you attack. But
even if you move out of range of your attacker,
their attack will resolve normally.

!!!You cannot run away from bullets that are already on their way!

## Moving
When you move: Assign a green die or a
white die to your movement. If you didn't
roll any green dice, choose a white die or
forgo movement, making it 0. Move a
number of ruler units equal to or less
than the result of your movement die. If
you have any movement systems or the
bonus d8 for carrying no ranged weapons,
you can pass through cover as though it
weren't there; otherwise, you have to go
around it. Any frame with a movement
system can also stand atop of cover.

!!! Any structure on the battlefield at least 3 bricks high counts as cover, including frames but excluding stations.

## Attacking
When making your attack, check whether
the target you designated is within the
range you declared. If not, you forgo the
attack. If it is in range, assign a red die
or a white die to your attack. Whites can
only be swapped in for ranged attacks in
if you have a weapon at that range. You
can voluntarily abort your attack by
choosing to assign no die to it. If you
abort the attack, the target does not get
activated. If your target is at 1 unit
range, you do not need red dice and can
use whites.

If it is within range, resolve your attack
now against its standing defense.

If the target has no defense die because
none was assigned when it had a turn,
count Defense as 0. If it doesn't have a
defense die because it has not been activated
yet, switch to combat order. Put
your turn on hold until your target has a
defense value assigned, then resolve your
attack normally.

If you are attacking cover directly, count
its defense as 0. Cover cannot be in cover
itself.

Once you've assigned an attack die and
told it to your target, it is too late to
abort.

## Spotting
Assign a yellow die or a white die to your
spot. If don't have any spotting systems,
you may still spot by assigning a white
die. Declare the target of your spot,
based on your spotting systems. Place a
yellow die next to your spotted target,
turned to the value of your spot die.

If the declared target is already spotted,
you can only replace the die if yours
would be higher. Otherwise, forgo your
spotting. You cannot spot first and follow
it up with your own attack. If you attack,
you spot after it has resolved. You
cannot spot cover or stations.

### Without spotting systems
The target must be:
 * within direct fire or hand to hand range
 * out of cover.

### With one system
The target must be:
 * within direct fire or hand-to-hand range
 * can be in cover.

### With two systems
You can spot everything.

## Resolving Attacks

If there is a spot on the target, you may
choose to add its value directly to your
attack value. If you do so, remove that
spot die from the field. It doesn't matter
who placed the spot, you can use anybody's
spot, and anybody can use yours.

!!! While this may seem odd, there is no effective downside to sharing spots. An opponent using your spot effectively helps your case by attacking another opponent for you!

Calculate your damage dice.

!!! Damage Dice = Spot + Attack – Defense

## Resolving Damage Dice

Roll one six-sided die for every damage
dice, and check the table for damage.

| Weapon       | Cover                   | Damages on...                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----       | :-----                  | :-----
| Melee        | Ignores cover           | 4, 5 & 6
| Ranged       | In cover                | 4 & 5 damages cover, 6 damages target
| Ranged       | Not in cover            | 5 & 6
| Ranged       | Covered by frame        | 5 damages cover frame, 6 damages target
| Any          | **Is** cover            | 4, 5 & 6 damage cover

Apply damage to the cover first, 4s before
5s. If the cover is destroyed mid-process,
treat the target as out of cover. Any
remaining 5s blow through and damage
the targeted frame. 6s always damage
the target.

Apply damage to a covering frame first. If
the covering frame is destroyed mid-process,
treat the target as out of cover. Any
remaining 5s after the cover frame's destruction
damage the targeted frame.

!!! If the covering mobile frame has two defensive systems it is not damaged by stray shots. A second defensive system allows a frame to **provide** cover without risking damage!

Cover cannot be spotted. Structures fewer
than 3 bricks high do not count as cover.
If you hit cover, every confirmed damage
roll removes 6 bricks, attacker's
choice.

!!! You can effectively raze your enemy's cover by leaving them with less than 3 brick tall ruins!

## Resolving Damage

For each point of damage a frame takes,
it loses one of its systems. The owner
chooses which system it loses. Pop off a
representative part of the frame and
drop it on the field. Since that system is
gone, it doesn’t provide its die or dice in
any future turns. If it has no systems left,
it loses one of its white dice. Once both
whites are gone, the frame is destroyed.

If the frame is within 1 unit range of a
station, its owner can choose to have it
ignore 1 damage and instead abandon its
position, moving the mobile frame 1 unit
away from the station, out of contesting
range.

!!! Taking damage doesn’t affect the dice you’ve already rolled unless the frame is destroyed. They’re yours to use until the end of this mobile frame’s turn. 

When a frame is destroyed, the owner
loses points accordingly — recalculate the
score.
