Put your cover and terrain pieces on the
playing field, except for stations. Any
player can adjust the battlefield layout
until everyone is satisfied. This may require
compromises. When every player
approves the layout of the battlefield,
deployment of stations and frames begins.

## Defense setup
The player with the highest starting score
places all of their stations. The defender
places all stations wherever they like,
within 1 ruler length of at least one other
station. Everything within the range of
one ruler length around these stations is
the defensive perimeter. Place two
frames within this defensive perimeter.

If you manage to position your stations in
a way that prohibits legal placement of
the attackers, then move your stations so
they leave at least one third of the battlefield
outside the defensive perimeter.

!!! It's probably to your advantage to place your frames at the advance edge of your perimeter

## Point Mobile Frame
The Point attacker goes next, placing the
point mobile frame:
* Out of cover.
* Outside the defensive player's perimeter.
* At 1 ruler length distance of at least one of the Defender's frames, in range for direct-fire.

## Attackers' frames
After this, all offensive players alternate,
descending by score, frame for frame,
until all frames are on the field.

** Frames are placed:**
* Outside the defensive perimeter.
* Outside direct fire range of any of the Defender's frames.
* Otherwise, unrestricted.

## Attackers' stations
Once all attacking frames are on the
field, attackers alternate again, placing
stations. On each of their turn, they
place one station, wherever they like.

## Defender's other frames.
The defender finishes placing all remaining
frames. There are no restrictions, except
frames placed outside the perimeter
must be in cover.
