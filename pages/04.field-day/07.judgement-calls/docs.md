Sometimes, situations are unclear. In that
case, favor the better outcome.

**In detail:**
* Defense: If it's a close call consider the defender to be in cover.
* Moving: If it's a close call allow the mobile frame to move to that position.
* Attack & Spot: If it's a close call consider the target to be in range.

!!! In general, try to favor positive results that produce action. Make things happen!
