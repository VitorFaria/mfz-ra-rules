If your playing field is bigger or smaller,
adjust accordingly. With a bigger table
than 6 ruler lengths, expand the ruler
units to match the table size, or tape off
the edges of corners of your gaming area
to stay within 4 to 6 lengths.

If your area is smaller than 4 rulers, reduce
the ruler to 6 units length. Weapon
ranges behave accordingly, so direct-fire
is now between 1 and 6 units, and artillery
starts beyond 6. Spotting behaves
just the same.
