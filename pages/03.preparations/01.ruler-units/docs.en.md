By default, you will play with a ruler that
eight units long, and one unit is a 1x4
click hinge brick or 5 studs in length.

Combining eight hinge bricks gives you a
ruler that can measure around corners.
Especially useful to plot paths through or
around cover and obstacles.

The game area should measure between
4 and 6 ruler lengths diagonally and circular;
or square. With hinge bricks, 4
lengths is the equivalent to about
45"/115cm. 6 lengths is the equivalent to
about 60"/150cm.

!!! As a general rule when measuring between two targets, measure between the closest points of them. Barrel to body part, blade to arm, back to cover, etc.
