Build several pieces of terrain. Terrain
can be stations, cover and just things
that look pretty. If you are playing with
rules for hazardous terrain, you should
also build pieces for that, such as
irradiated ground or perilous plants.

## Stations
Stations have distinct properties:
* Distinct from terrain and cover.
* Have a location to put a marker.
* Maximum base size is 4 × 4.

There are no other limits stations. For
stations, build anything that is valuable
to defend or seize. The door panel on a
drop ship, a cache of medical supplies, a
research facility’s data storage drives, a
truck with a flat tire and a load of fresh
peaches.

!!! If you use something with a larger base, mark the section that is the station. The rest is regular cover.

## Cover
Any structure on the battlefield is cover
if it's 3 bricks or more high, except
stations.

**A frame counts as in cover, if:**
* Within 1 unit range of the structure.
* The cover is between the combatants.

If there are terrain pieces anywhere else
between target and attacker but further
away than 1 unit of the target, ignore
them.

!!! When building your cover, make the height about 6 to 8 bricks tall, so the cover provides a large enough surface to provide protection.

Additionally, frames that have not been
destroyed count as cover, too. Even
hostile ones!

!!! Instead of entire terrain pieces, count only actual bricks for the purpose of cover.

## Other terrain

You can also build terrain that is not a
station and less than 3 bricks in height.
Such elements are just eye-candy, unless
you are playing with the additional rules
for hazardous terrain. Optionally, you can
build difficult terrain which does not
provide cover, but still requires a movement
system to traverse.
