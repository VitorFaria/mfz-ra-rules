Each frame has a dicepool for its actions,
starting with 2 white dice representing
the basic machine and the pilot's regular
senses. You can expand this dicepool with
up to 4 systems. No more than 2 systems
of any given type can be equipped, but
otherwise load-outs are unrestricted.

Yet, even without any systems present, a
mobile frame can do several things using
its white dice for these purposes.

**Actions :**
* Defend itself.
* Move, navigate around cover.
* Spot a target out of cover in direct-fire range.
* Attack at hand-to hand range.

Systems are restricted to their specific
uses, but having one or more equipped
unlocks certain special abilities that
white dice cannot perform as well, if at
all. Additionally, without any weapon systems
present, a frame can only attack at
1 unit range, for hand-to-hand combat.
Since MFZ is a game about attacking,
such a frame would be at great disadvantage.
