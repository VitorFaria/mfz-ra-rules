If you want to field larger frames, keep in
mind that you will need to adjust your
ruler. Spitball the size difference and
manufacture a ruler that fits the new
scale.

Subsequent measurements, such as
direct-fire all work according to this new
ruler. If you expand the ruler by a
considerable amount, keep in mind that
your gaming area will also increase in
size.
