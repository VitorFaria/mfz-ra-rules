## Single Shot Rockets
Every Company starts with 3 SSR, which
can be put in any configuration on any
frame, as long as the total of 3 is
present.

| #       | Dice    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----  | :-----  | :-----
| 0       |  redd8  | Adds one red d8. Range : 2 units to 1 ruler. Discarded after one use. Indestructible.

> Examples : Hand grenade, rocket pod, underslung launcher.

A frame can carry all three of these, if
you so choose. Since SSRs do **not** count as
systems they cannot be destroyed.

## Sprinting
If a frame has neither direct-fire or artillery
weapon systems installed, it receives
a bonus d8 for its movement, which allows
it to traverse cover, too.

| #       | Dice    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-----  | :-----  | :-----
| 0       | greend8 | Adds one green d8. May move through cover. Indestructible.

> Examples : Sprinting is a benefit of carrying no ammunition.

Since Sprinting is **not** a system, it cannot
be destroyed. If a frame which has
ranged weaponry loses those due to damage,
it automatically gains this bonus.

## Hint : the "Soldier" configuration
A soldier-configured frame carries 1 defensive
system, 1 movement system, 1 spotting system,
and 1 direct fire weapon system. Every other
mobile frame is a specialist of sort. When
you’re creating your frames, an easy way to
start is to make a soldier configuration and then
swap systems in and out to specialize as
needed.

## Recap : Die configuration notation
Count each of a frame's dice and list
them off as you deal with them to give a
quick description of a loadout. Every
frame starts with “WW”, for two white
d6. Add the other dice accordingly.

For attack dice, add a lowercase letter to
indicate the range it is used at.
* h = Hand-to-hand
* d = Direct-fire
* r = Rocket – still direct-fire; for distinction.
* a = Artillery

If a frame has any d8, just add the 8
after the color, such as G8 or R8d. SSR
are labeled as R8r – Red, d8, “rocket”
range letter.

**Example:**
A Soldier frame with two SSR would be
WWBYGRdRdR8rR8r. It has its two white
dice, one dice for Defense (blue), Spotting
(yellow), Movement (green) and two
dice for Attack (red) at direct-fire range
(d) and its two rockets (R8r).
