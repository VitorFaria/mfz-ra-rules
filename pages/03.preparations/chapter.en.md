# Preparations!
To play MFZ, you will need to prepare a
few things before you can dive into the
fight. Since building is a huge part of the
MFZ experience, take your time when
building your army. As long as they fit
within the scale, anything you can come
up with is considered legal. It is beneficial
to have the individual systems of
your frames visible, though.

** You will need : **
* One company of mobile frames per player.
* Some terrain pieces, for cover and stations.
* One ruler, eight units long.
* A dice assortment depending on your company.
* A way to track the doomsday clock in 11 steps.
