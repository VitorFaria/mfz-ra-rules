Weapon ranges in MFZ are exclusive to
one another and not “downwards-compatible.”

**Range increments:**
* Hand-to-hand, up to 1 unit.
* Direct-fire, above 1 unit, up to 1 ruler length.
* Artillery, beyond 1 ruler length.

This means that direct-fire cannot be
used at hand-to-hand range, just as artillery
cannot be used at either hand-tohand
or direct-fire range. Each weapon
system only works within its increment.

If you are unsure about the ranges
between things, you can measure at any
time during the game, even out of turn.

!!! When you measure, measure from the closest points between target and attacker. When in doubt, the target is in range.
