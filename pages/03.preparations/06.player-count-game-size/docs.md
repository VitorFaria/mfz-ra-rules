MFZ has two game sizes â€” Skirmish and
Battle. Skirmishes go faster but are usually
more fierce, whereas battles can go
for a long time. Battles are where the
battlefield carnage is usually the
greatest. Decide with your players what
kind of game you want to play and consult
the tables for the company sizes and
stations to bring.
