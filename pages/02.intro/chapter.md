# Introduction

Mobile Frame Zero:Rapid Attack is a tabletop wargame designed to be played with LEGO robots,
with rules that are accessible to a broad spectrum of ages and provide casual fun as well as highpitched,
intense battles. With a unique setting that allows for myriads of builds when it comes to Mobile Frames
and their companies, MFZ is for the builder, the wargamer and everyone in between.


The game was released summer of 2012,
but is based on the 2002 game
'Mechaton', which was just the crunch of
the rules you see here. MFZ has been revised
by Joshua A.C. Newman, with the
help of Mechaton's inventor, Vincent
Baker and his son Sebastian Baker. Joshua
also got Soren Roberts on board, a Lego
designer and freelance graphics artist
who has some repute on FlickR for his microscale
spaceships, anime-inspired
mecha and other Lego creations.

MFZ was made to bring affordable wargaming
to the kitchen table, without relying
on prebuilt models, allowing for as
intricate or simple models as a player
likes. With that, MFZ is abstracted quite
far, simplifying many elements which are
much more elaborate in other wargames.
MFZ is also heavily favouring action over
inaction. With emphasis on attacking, a
timer to keep things fast paced, and an
intentional shortage of resources, every
decision is meant to be tough. High risk
elements combined with strategic
sacrifices is what makes MFZ an
entertaining game.
