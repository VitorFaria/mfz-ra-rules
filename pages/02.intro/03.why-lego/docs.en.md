LEGO® has multiple advantages for wargames.
For example, many people
already have LEGO® at home that they can
use to build mobile frames for MFZ:RA.
Additionally, once a robot is built, there
is no need to paint it up, reducing the
prep time until one can actually play.
This is also true if a player wants to try
out different compositions — all it takes
is a few different bricks. Since there is
also a large international community that
builds these LEGO® robots, there is no
shortage of inspiration for new and
starting builders.
