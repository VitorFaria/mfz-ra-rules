Mobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack is the
tenth anniversary edition of Vincent
Baker's Mechaton. Build yourself a company
of robots called mobile frames out
of LEGO®, give yourself some objectives
to defend, lay out a table with a few
friends, and fight!

Because, just like a LEGO® set, building
what's on the front of the box is fun, but
building your own thing is where it really
catches fire. So that's what we want you
to do! Build robots, play with our setting,
sure! If you're into VOTOMS, Dougram,
Macross, or Gasaraki, then we
want to play with you!
