title: Scale and size restrictions

MFZ uses what is called the 7p scale. Essentially,
an average human is 7 plates of
Lego tall. That means that anything else
modeled should reflect this, so when two
forces meet, they look roughly at the
same dimensions. 7 plates is two bricks
and a plate on top.

As loose rule of thumb, frames should
generally fit inside a box that is 10 studs
wide, 10 studs deep and 12 bricks tall.
There is some wiggle room for
quadrupeds, but it should generally be
observed as the maximum. Size creep can
quickly become an issue. Since there is a
definitive size for humans, this also
requires some space where the human
can fit inside a frame â€” generally, the
torso. Otherwise, MFZ has no restrictions
on what a frame should look like, what
colors or parts to be used, and if you
don't want to use Legos, a Gundam model
with removable systems is fine, too.
