In the Solar Calendar, as Joshua calls the
timeline and universe of MFZ, humanity
has surpassed the boundaries of Earth
and is traveling deep into space using
Transit Gates to cover the distance. The
majority of the manual labor is conducted
by Mobile Frames, large machines
somewhere between exoskeleton and
full-blown mecha. They are three to four
times as tall as humans and develop six
times their lift and carrying capabilities,
while retaining human mobility and most
of the agility. These mobile frames were
sooner, rather than later, integrated into
military purposes, and are used as the
one-stop solution to anything that requires
force on the ground. While the
military and paramilitary organizations of
the Solar Calendar use combat-specific
builds, many rebels or less fortunate
mercenaries use repurposed labor frames
just the same. This book will use the
term “frame” when referring to Mobile
Frames, combat-oriented or otherwise.
