title: Per-frame initiative

With this optional rule, every frame has
their own initiative. If a frame has less
than four systems, roll 2d20. If it has four
systems, roll 1d20. Leave the dice as
markers next to the frames.

When a round starts, tactical order starts
with the frame that has the lowest number,
and goes through the sequence, up
to 20. If a frame has 2d20, you can pick
which one to use as soon as your lower
number comes up. Once chosen, the initiative
remains for the duration of the
game. Alternatively, roll again for every
new round for even more chaos and unpredictable
outcomes.

!!! While this adds considerable amount of time to a round, it opens up for a more varied playing field and tactical options. Keep in mind, though, this favors attackers, that normally have the lowest initiatives.
