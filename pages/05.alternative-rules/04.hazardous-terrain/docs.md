Before you create your companies, you
can agree as a group to include hazardous
terrain in your upcoming battlefield.
When you build your frames, you can give
them an appropriate environmental system.

It counts against your limit of 4 systems
per mobile frame. In order to function effectively
in hostile terrain, a mobile
frame needs the appropriate environmental
system. Without it, when you roll
dice reduce your white dies by one.

> **Examples:** When fighting in the vacuum of space on a ship's hull, a frame might need magnetized soles. When wading through a swamp with irritating gases, a sealed air system is important. Whilst
in subzero conditions, a thermal unit would be
advisable.
