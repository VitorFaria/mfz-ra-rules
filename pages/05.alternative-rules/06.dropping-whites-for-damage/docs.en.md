title: Dropping Whites for damage

If one of your frames takes damage, you
may want to drop a White instead of a
system — either because you do not want
to lose your last weapon or foresee that
you get more use out of the special effect
of that system being present over
the versatility of the White.

Keep in mind that you cannot drop your
last White, though — a frame will still be
destroyed when all Whites are gone.
