With everyone’s approval, you can declare
your weapon systems to be splitrange.
For purposes of building your
frames, a split weapon counts as two
half-systems, one of each type. A split
hand to hand/ direct weapon counts as
half a hand to hand weapon system and
half a direct fire weapon system, for instance.
You still aren’t allowed to have
more than 2 systems of each type.

> **Examples:**
>
> A split-range pistol might add one red die at direct fire and one red die at hand to hand.
>
> A split-range scoped assault rifle might add one red die at direct fire range and one red die at artillery range.

!!! While this rule is quite commonly used with MFZ players, keep in mind: You sacrifice reliability for flexibility.
