Before you field your companies, you can
agree as a group to allow climbing. Mobile
frames can gain benefit from climbing
onto structures if they're at least 6
bricks high and at least 4 studs in area.
When a mobile frame moves, climbing up
or down 6 bricks' height counts the same
as moving 1 ruler unit horizontally.

!!! Of course you need terrain to use this optional rule. Build several pieces that provide elevation.

To climb, a mobile frame has to have at
least one appropriate movement system.
A mobile frame with no movement systems
can climb stairs or a ladder, if it’s
built into the structure.

A higher mobile frame is in cover to all
lower mobile frames. A lower mobile
frame is out of cover to any higher mobile
frames, unless it’s under a roof. Mobile
frames at the same elevation determine
cover normally. Don’t consider
elevation differences less than 6 bricks.

If a mobile frame falls — for instance if
the structure it stood on is destroyed — it
could take damage. Roll 1 damage die for
every 3 bricks' height the frame fell, and
use the damage chart for hand to hand
attacks.
