Every company must carry the same number
of single-shot rockets. By default,
every company has three. Before you create
your companies, you can agree as a
group to some other number. Fewer,
down to zero, will make the battle closer
and harder-fought, with the attacker at
the disadvantage. More, up to say six or
eight, will make the battle bloodier and
more uncertain, with the attackers at the
advantage â€“ more rockets, more carnage!
